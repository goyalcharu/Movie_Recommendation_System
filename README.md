# Movie_Recommendation_System

## AIM:
- Aim-1: To make a recommendation system which suggests movies of the genre we input and print them in descending order on the basis of their ratings.
* Aim-2: To input a movie name and display its timeline, year of release, genre and IMDB rating.
+ Aim-3: To input a year/ time period and to display movies released during that period.

The primary goal of the project is to go through the dataset and the general data analysis process using numpy, pandas, matplotlib and sns. This contains four parts:
1. Introduction
2. Data Cleaning/Preprocessing
3. Exploratory data analysis
4. Conclusions
